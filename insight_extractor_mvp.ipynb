      "\n",
      "1. Encountering a large number of unexpected fields in the API response, leading to confusion.\n",
      "   Impact: Wasted time and effort in understanding data fieldsâ€”defining which ones to use takes longer than necessary.\n",
      "   Quote: I ended up dumping the response into a JSON viewer and going field by field.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Inconsistent API response formats across different endpoints, which complicates onboarding for new developers.\n",
      "   Impact: Increased training time and reduced onboarding efficiency.\n",
      "   Quote: Right now, some endpoints return arrays, others wrap everything in an object with metadata.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Lack of observability in the API, making it difficult to detect issues until they become significant problems.\n",
      "   Impact: Increased response times to problems; potential customer dissatisfaction due to undetected errors.\n",
      "   Quote: If something goes wrong, I only notice when logs blow up or when a customer reports it.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. No real testing sandbox, forcing reliance on potentially harmful testing methods.\n",
      "   Impact: Risk of corrupting production data and increased stress during deployment.\n",
      "   Quote: Yeah, once we polluted real data by mistake. Had to clean it up. Stressful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "JOBS-TO-BE-DONE:\n",

      "1. Functional: Integrate the API for generating custom reports.\n",

      "2. Functional: Optimize data retrieval with the API to reduce development time.\n",

      "3. Functional: Test API response behavior in a safe environment.\n",

      "WORKAROUNDS:\n",

      "1. Writing little scripts to experiment with API responses and find functionalities.\n",
      "   Why: To deal with the lack of clarity in response data structure and field usage.\n",
      "   Cost: Time spent creating, debugging, and maintaining these scripts.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Searching through old repositories to understand how fields were previously used.\n",
      "   Why: To bridge the gap in knowledge about API responses without clear documentation.\n",

      "2. Improved observability features like metrics on latency, error rates, and success ratios.\n",
      "   Gap: Currently, only alerted to issues through error logging or customer reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. A dedicated sandbox environment for safe API testing.\n",
      "   Gap: Lack of a realistic testing environment forces reliance on risky production testing.\n",
